/*:
## 3.5&mdash;CollectionType with Queue Example

_Acknowledgement: This playground follows and simplifies to an intermediate level Section 3.5 of [Advanced Swift]( https://www.objc.io/books/advanced-swift/ ), by Chris Eidhof and Airspeed Velocity._ The section begins by explaning how CollectionType builds on SequenceType, and then illustrates it by implementing a Queue.
