# Various Playgrounds Illustrating Intermediate Swift

These playgrounds were most recently updated using Xcode 7.3 and are compatible with Swift 2.2.

These playgrounds are commented with markdown. If a playground doesn't look pretty in Xcode, find "Show Rendered Markup" in the "Editor" menu and toggle rendering on. Conversely, if you are seeing the rendered markup, but you want to see or edit the raw file, in the same menu, find "Show Raw Markup" and toggle rendering off.

## Acknowledgement

The playgrounds in this repository correspond to sections in [Advanced Swift]( https://www.objc.io/books/advanced-swift ), by Chris Eidhof and Airspeed Velocity, and I gratefully acknowledge their permission to turn a limited number of their book sections into playground code.

## Annotated Bibliography

* Apple's book on [The Swift Programming Language (Swift 2.2)]( https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/the-swift-programming-language/id881256329?mt=11 ).
* My summary of [Basic Swift]( http://github.com/brianhill/basic-swift ). Created to compensate for the verbosity of the preceding reference.
* As acknowledged above, these playgrounds follow the outline of some sections of [Advanced Swift]( https://www.objc.io/books/advanced-swift/ ), a recently published book by Chris Eidhof and Airspeed Velocity. Their presentation is somewhat more advanced than these playgrounds (that's why I called these playgrounds "Intermediate Swift"). You will want to read their presentation to understand the material I elided.
* Additional advanced material by Chris Eidhof, Florian Kugler and Wouter Swierstra is in [Functional Swift]( https://www.objc.io/books/functional-swift/ ). Functional methods are worth going deeply into if you want to abstractly manipulate operations on data, as if the operations themselves were data.
* My [Problem Set #4]( http://github.com/brianhill/cs190-ps4 ), contains exercises, including unit tests that give immediate feedback on your solutions.
