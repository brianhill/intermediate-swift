* [St. Mary's Home Page](http://physics.stmarys-ca.edu/lecturers/brianrhill/index.html)

Prerequisites:

* [Basic Swift Playground](http://github.com/brianhill/basic-swift)
* [Apple's Swift 2.1 Guide]

Playgrounds:

* The [Collections Playground](./Collections.playground/Contents.swift) is a work in progress.
* The Functions Playground is forthcoming.

References:

* These playgrounds follow _and_ _simplify_ some chapters of [Advanced Swift](https://www.objc.io/books/advanced-swift/), a forthcoming book by Chris Eidhof and Airspeed Velocity. Pre-release copies are available, and the book is already complete enough that this is a good time to buy it. Although these playgrounds stand on their own, they could be used with that reference to understand the same subject matter at an advanced level.
* Additional advanced material by Chris Eidhof, Florian Kugler and Wouter Swierstra is in [Functional Swift](https://www.objc.io/books/functional-swift/). Functional methods are definitely worth learning if you want to abstractly manipulate operations, as if the operations themselves were data.
