# Various Playgrounds Illustrating Intermediate Swift

## Acknowledgement

These playgrounds follow the outline of the corresponding chapters in [Advanced Swift](https://www.objc.io/books/advanced-swift), by Chris Eidhof and Airspeed Velocity. Although these playgrounds stand on their own, they could be used with that reference in hand to take your understanding to an advanced level.

## List of Playgrounds in this Repository

* The [Collections Playground](./Collections.playground/Contents.swift) is a work in progress.
* The Functions Playground is forthcoming.

## Annotated Bibliography

* [Apple's Swift 2.1 Guide](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/the-swift-programming-language/id881256329?mt=11) (may redirect to iTunes or iBooks). Keep this reference in hand while you are learning basic Swift. It is intended to be sufficient for someone new to programming, not just new to Swift.
* A summary of [Basic Swift](http://github.com/brianhill/basic-swift). Created to compensate for the verbosity of the preceding reference.
* As noted above, these playgrounds follow the outline of [Advanced Swift](https://www.objc.io/books/advanced-swift/), a forthcoming book by Chris Eidhof and Airspeed Velocity. Pre-release copies are available, and the book is already mostly complete and polished.
* Additional advanced material by Chris Eidhof, Florian Kugler and Wouter Swierstra is in [Functional Swift](https://www.objc.io/books/functional-swift/). Functional methods are definitely worth learning if you want to abstractly manipulate operations on data, as if the operations themselves were data.
