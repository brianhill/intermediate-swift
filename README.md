## Annotated Bibliography

* [Apple's Swift 2.1 Guide](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/the-swift-programming-language/id881256329?mt=11).
* A summary of [Basic Swift](http://github.com/brianhill/basic-swift). Created to compensate for the verbosity of the preceding reference.
* As noted above, these playgrounds follow the outline of [Advanced Swift](https://www.objc.io/books/advanced-swift/), a forthcoming book by Chris Eidhof and Airspeed Velocity. Pre-release copies are available, and the book is already mostly complete and polished.
* Additional advanced material by Chris Eidhof, Florian Kugler and Wouter Swierstra is in [Functional Swift](https://www.objc.io/books/functional-swift/). Functional methods are worth going deeply into if you want to abstractly manipulate operations on data, as if the operations themselves were data.
* [Problem Set #4](http://github.com/brianhill/cs190-ps4.git), contains some exercises and unit tests to check your work.
