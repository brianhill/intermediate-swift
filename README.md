The playgrounds are commented with markdown. If a playground doesn't look pretty in Xcode, find "Show Rendered Markup" in the "Editor" (not "Edit") menu and turn it on. If you are seeing the rendered markup, but you want to see or edit the raw file, in the same menu, find "Show Raw Markup" and turn that on.

The [Collections Playground](./Collections.playground/Contents.swift) follows and simplifies the material in the "Collections" Chapter of [Advanced Swift](https://www.objc.io/books/advanced-swift/) by Chris Eidhof and Airspeed Velocity. To understand Swift at an advanced level, this playground should be used with that reference in hand.
